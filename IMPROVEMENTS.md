# Future Improvements

Given more time and resources, the following improvements could be implemented to enhance the system:

## 1. Concurrency Improvements
- **Thread Optimization**: Improve the threading mechanism to allow faster and more efficient concurrent transfers.

## 2. Validation
- **Transfer Limits**: Introduce validation rules to limit the transfer amount.
    - For example, set a maximum transfer limit per transaction to prevent large-scale fraud or errors.
    - Add business rules for different account types to impose specific constraints.

## 3. Security Enhancements
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Secure the API using standard security practices.
    - Implement **JWT-based authentication** to ensure that only authenticated users can access the endpoints.
    - Use **Spring Security** to manage role-based access control (e.g., only authorized users can initiate transfers).

## 4. Database Transaction Management
- **Database Integration**: Replace the in-memory data store with a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
    - Use **Spring Data JPA** for database interactions.
    - Implement **transaction management** to ensure consistency during transfers and rollback on failure.

## 5. Logging
- **Logging**: Add proper logging throughout the application for better observability.
    - Use **SLF4J/Logback** to capture important events (e.g., successful transfers, exceptions).
    - Implement **transaction tracing** to log steps involved in money transfers for better debugging and auditing.

## 6. Testing Enhancements
- **Test Coverage**: Improve unit and integration test coverage.
    - Add tests for edge cases like concurrent transfers and race conditions.
    - Implement **load testing** to evaluate performance under heavy traffic.

## 7. Documentation
- **Design Document**: Provide detailed documentation on the system design, including architecture and key decisions.

- **Open API Specification**: Use **Swagger** to generate and maintain the API documentation.
    - This would help in visualizing the endpoints and testing them interactively.

- **Changelogs**: Maintain a changelog for each version or update of the service.
    - Keep track of new features, bug fixes, and improvements.

- **Commenting**: Add proper comments in the code to explain the logic and flow.
    - This will help future developers understand the system quickly.

## 8. Monitoring and Health Checks (Spring Boot Actuator)
- **Spring Boot Actuator**: Integrate **Spring Boot Actuator** to monitor the health and metrics of the application.
    - Enable endpoints like `/actuator/health` to check the health of the application in real-time.
    - Use additional metrics like `/metrics`, `/info`, and `/env` to gather details about the application's state and environment.
